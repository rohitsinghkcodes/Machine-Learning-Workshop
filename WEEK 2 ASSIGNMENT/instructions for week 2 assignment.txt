welcome to week 2
If you are reading this, you probably have a decent overview of feature engineering and ML
This week's assignment is a little tricky but comparitively easier than last time

You have to design 3 functions:
1. A data cleaning pipeline - you will be given the training data beforehand and all the data cleaning process should be ecompassed in this function.Create the function is such a way that it only takes the input of the name of the file and it outputs a cleaned and ready to work dataframe
2. An ML model trainer function-a function which when given data in form of x,y returns a trained model
3. An Ml model tester function- a function which when given test data (x) and actual predictions(y) returns the accuracy and if possible prints a plot of confusion matrix

scoring:
data visualization of dataset: 2
creation of function 1: 3
creation of function 2: 2
creation if function 3: 3

I believe you guys will get very good accuracy so accuracy holds bonus points if and only if it is in the range of 85 to 95

only training data will be provided and test data will be given while on video call with the team leader and he or his teammate shall present their work.

code is to be submitted by saturday midnight
date of evaluation will be released soon.
